## 📌 About the Project

This project's purpose is to **showcase my coding skills, coding practices, and design standards** so that potential collaborators or employers can have a clear idea of:

- How I structure codebases for maintainability.
- The UI/UX quality standards I adhere to.
- My approach to clean, consistent, and scalable architecture.

this is **not built for follow-along learning**.

This project also **addresses a real-world problem** in Tunisia’s real estate market. Currently, most property rental and sales activities happen on **Facebook**, which leads to messy, unorganized interactions.

Once the **Minimum Lovable Product (MLP)** is ready, it will be **hosted and advertised for free use** to help people and agencies in Tunisia.

## 🚀 Project Status

⚠️ **Work In Progress (WIP)**
The project is currently in active development, moving toward the first **Minimum Lovable Product (MLP)** release.

## 🧭 Goals of this Project

1. **Showcase engineering practices** → readable, consistent, and scalable code.
2. **Demonstrate UI/UX standards** → clean, user-friendly, and accessible design.
3. **Solve a real local problem** → make renting/buying real estate in Tunisia simpler and more transparent.
4. **Build with future-proofing in mind** → clear structure and coding philosophy that supports scaling and collaboration.

## 🧑‍💻 Coding Philosophy

This project follows my personal **coding philosophy**:

- **Keep It Simple**: I prioritize clarity and readability over unnecessary abstraction. Abstractions are only introduced when they clearly reduce complexity and improve maintainability.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each service, utility, or component is responsible for a single piece of logic. For example, API integration, caching, and domain-specific features are implemented in **dedicated, reusable service modules**.
- **Self-explanatory Code**: By writing code that communicates intent through structure and naming, I minimize the need for redundant comments. The codebase remains clean and approachable for new developers.
- **Monorepo for Simplicity**: The entire project is structured as a **monorepo**, keeping both the front-end and back-end in one place. This ensures:

These practices result in a **maintainable, scalable, and developer-friendly codebase** that can grow without turning into a burden.
